# tshbot

`tshbot` is a lightweight tool that enables you to execute shell commands on Linux systems via Telegram.

Initially it was developed with the idea of conveniently running commands on devices like Raspberry Pi remotely, eliminating the need to use SSH. Designed for ease of use, `tshbot` eliminates the need for complex setups such as VPNs or NAT traversal, simplifying your remote management experience.
